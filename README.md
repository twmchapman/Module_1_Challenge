# Module 1 Challenge - Robinhood

## Overview and Origin

* Robinhood Markets Inc.

* Founded in April 2013 by Vladmir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt

* Vladmir and Baiju were roommates at Standford University before starting two fintech business' in New York selling software to hedge funds. However, after their experience working in the finance industry they noticed the next-to-zero brokerage fees large Wall Street investors were required to pay compared to your average American investor. Hence, the founders sought to create a business that would provide everyone with affordable access to financial markets, not just the wealthy. (Robinhood, 2022)

* Robinhood is currently valued on the Nasdaq at USD$6.97bn (as at 26/6/22) after raising a total of $6.2bn in equity-sourced funds over 29 rounds (Crunchbase, 2022) with their IPO in July '21 raising their largest amount, close to USD$2bn (Johnston, 2021)


## Business Activities:

* They key problem Robinhood are aiming to solve is the inequitable access to investing in financial markets that institutional funds have previously had over individual investors. Robinhood aim to "democratize finance for all" (Robinhood, 2022), providing an affordable, approachable and understandable investing app for both new and experienced investors.

* In an interview with CNBC, the founders told their app targets first-time investors and millenials in particular who "want to make their feet wet and learn about how the stock market works" (CNBC, 2015). Using the millenial population of the US, Robinhood have a minimum TAM of 72.1m people with the upside of people outside of this generation group who haven't invested before or want an easier platform for smaller investments. Robinhood's competitive advantage was initially creating an easy-to-use mobile app and online platform, with 0 brokerage fees or minimum investment amounts, earning money on razor thin margins on substantially larger customer traffic. This is compared to traditional stock brokerage firms who would price out majority of the US population with large fees and high minimum investment amounts. However the industry has since been swamped with other players who have developed similar platforms to Robinhood and they are seeking to compete now on access to further financial instruments such as Crypto and becoming a neo-bank.

* Robinhood is cloud-native business and therefore uses AWS for cloud hosting. They initially built the platform on Python/Django however they have been shifting towards the Go programming language. With their microservices, most of the API's are written in Python and Go, with some Java and Rust in their codebase (Quastor, 2022). They have recently partnered with the Nasdaq to source real-time stock information as well (Crunchbase, 2022).
 

## Landscape: Investment Management

* Robinhood operates in the Investment Management domain

* The overarching trend in the investment management domain over the last 5-10 years, that Robinhood have infact been leading the charge, is the shift from investing through brokers over the phone to instead utilising the internet and phone apps to invest on our own behalf. Another key trend that is still having an immense influence is the rise of Crypto and NFT investments. This is becoming another investment vehicle that a lot of people are turning to for decentralised investment management. 

* Some of the large legacy investment managers that dominate the domain include Blackrock, Vanguard and UBS. However the more tech central players in this domain are eToro, E-Trade, Coinbase and Superhero who generally focus on delivering similar service in specific regions


## Results

* Robinhood has been a trailblazer for providing access to new "retail investors" having brought upwards of 20m investors in the US and over $80bn in assets invested (CNBC, 2021). Further, Morningstar quoted a external calculation that the demand from Robinhood users brought an increase in the value of the US stock market by 1% in the second quarter of CY21. This is exemplified by the influence of retail investors on the GameStop (GME) saga, that whilst it was arguably a struggling company, the power of the internet to develop retail engagement and the consequent ease of access to invest are some of the key influences of companies like Robinhood

* One of the first metrics this Domain is marked on is the number of users with funded accounts, for which Robinhood has 22.8m users as at March '22 (Statista, 2022). That is compared to E-trade wtih 5.2m users and Superhero's >100k. Another key metric is the total assets under management through the platform, for which Robinhood currently holds $80bn, that whilst impressive compares to E-trade's $800bn and Charles Schwab's $3.8tn. 


## Recommendations

* One key recommendation I would make in order to remain current with their target market is include a NFT trading platform, which would pair well with their recent addition of crypto investments. I think also from an social governance persepctive it would be worthwhile investing more into an integrated learning platform for all of their investment options so new investors have the resources available to make informed investment decisions. Lastly, I would recommend providing access to more equity markets such as European and Australian markets. 

Overall these recommended additions will allow Robinhood to remain relevant to their millenium market's interest in Web3 investments, aswell as remain competitive in the rapdily growing online investment managemnet space where creating a platform that is a one-stop shop for investors having access to all global investment options will make customers much stickier. Lastly the addition of a larger education platform similar to lets say Duolingo for languages, will support greater investment down the track should the company need it as investors seek socially responsible business' that arent just profiting of other people's wins/losses. 

* Overall i'd imagine these recommendations would require extensions of currently used technologies. For the cloud-hosting of education and other investment options they would use AWS. The education compotent would require more JavaScript then python for the actual web development due to the ease of updating with more education modules. Lastly they would require various Ethereum and OpenSea API's to build out their NFT trading platform.
